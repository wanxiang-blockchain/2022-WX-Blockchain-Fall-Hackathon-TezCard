# What is TezCard?

We have joined enough DAO but there have no DAO toolset to help the DAOs which has no developer but also has the requirement for manage tool. For example some blockchain fans could join in their own DAO wanna to find out the Gold in Web3 but if they have no toolset. Then they just funding and make decition off-chain suffering some attack risk.

So we have implement a flavor DAO toolset on Tezos named TezCard.

In this toolset, we have specific two specification into `Memebershio` and `Voting`. Based on the `Memebrship` any developer could develop some tools for DAO managers such as `On-Chain Profile` `On-Chain VC`. Using the Tezos lambda the developer also could build a new voting tool over the DID in TezCard to execute any action.

Memebership we have splited in to two concept to join

1. Fixed-Rank 
2. Time-Elapsed
